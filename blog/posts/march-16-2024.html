                    Today marks the creation of my very own website.
                    I've been wanting to create a website for a while now, and I finally decided to do it.
                </p>

                <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
                <p>
                    The problem that I've always faced when building my own website came down to a few things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>I don't know how to code</li>
                        <li>A lot of options on making a website without code cost money</li>
                        <li>I'm not a very good designer</li>
                    </ol>
                    As you can imagine, those barriers that were placed before me made it extremley difficult to create a website that I truly felt proud of.
                </p>

                <h2>Discovery</h2>
                <p>
                    On this day, I was scrolling on Twitter, (I'm not calling it X), and found a tool called Cursor.
                    It's a coding tool that uses AI to help you code. Which was perfect for me because I don't know how to code.
                    That was the tool that I used to create this website. <br>
                    Although it sounds like I'm advertising for them, I'm not. I genuienly do believe that Cursor is a great tool that can help many people.
                    And I do recognize the implications or the stigma of AI that it will "steal" jobs.
                    But I believe that it will only make jobs easier and more efficient.
                </p>

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on reguaraly updating this website and adding more content to it.
                    I will be essentially adding my resume and utilizing this website as a portfolio.
